# LLM Entity Explorer

## Overview

The **LLM Entity Explorer** is an advanced Python application designed for processing and analyzing textual data. Utilizing cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this application extracts valuable insights from text, including event types, entities, names, emails, phone numbers, and geographical data. To enhance the accuracy and relevance of information extraction, **prompt engineering** has been implemented, ensuring that the most pertinent data is retrieved effectively.

**Deep Infra** provides cutting-edge large language models (LLMs) at a low cost, allowing users to harness the power of advanced machine learning without the complexities of managing GPU infrastructure. With the help of APIs, users can seamlessly integrate these models into their applications, enabling efficient and scalable solutions for text processing and analysis.
